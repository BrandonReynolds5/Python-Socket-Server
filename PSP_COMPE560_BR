The following files implement the Python Socket Programming assignment through the two files: Client_COMPE560_BR.py and Server_COMPE560_BR.py
In order to run the server and clients first you must find an application that can run python code. This project was done on IDLE on Mac OS which
was able to run python shells for the files. When you have found something to run the files, first run the Server_COMPE560_BR.py file to activate
the server IP for use. If you choose to change the IP you can do so within the file. Then you must run the Client_COMPE560_BR.py for each client 
you would like to add to the chat seperately. A method of doing this if on Mac OS is to start new seesions of IDLE through the running the command
"idle3 &" for each new instance you need. When you run the client pyhto file, a GUI should appear where you can connect, send and receive messages,
and quit the server. To send messages, the client first press "connect" to connect to the server where the GUI will notify the user if they connected.
Then the user must simply type what they want to say in the box above "connect" and then click "send" to send their message. Incoming messages will be
displayed where the client messages are sent all users will have their IP addresses and Ports displayed next to their message. When the user is done 
they can click "quit" to disconnect from the server.
